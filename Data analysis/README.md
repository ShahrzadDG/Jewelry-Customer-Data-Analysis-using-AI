Aims: Analyzing customer reviews and ratings from the jewelry subset of Amazon data to understand customer expectations and product trends.

I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine brand performance, rating distributions, time-based trends, and price segments.

I processed large-scale text review and rating data to identify patterns in customer sentiment, preferences, and common issues.

I quantified the impact of different complaint types (durability, size, appearance, and color) on product ratings using regression analysis to identify which issues most strongly drive customer dissatisfaction.

- Worked with a large-scale dataset (~6.8M reviews, ~800k products, ~23k brands) to understand the jewelry market on Amazon.

- Cleaned and structured the data to analyze products, brands, prices, ratings, and review texts.

- Compared brand performances:

    - Aggregated product ratings for each brand, used a weighted score to avoid bias from products with very few reviews.
    - Ranked ~11k+ brands based on both rating and review volume.

- Analyzed how brands perform over time (2004–2023):
    - Tracked yearly brand rankings.
    - Observed how top brands change over time.
    - Followed the evolution of large brands (e.g. Amazon Collection) in terms of rating and popularity.

- Explored price behavior in detail:

    - Analyzed full price distribution (highly skewed, long tail up to ~33k $).

- Investigated relationship between price and satisfaction:

    - Tested whether expensive brands are actually better rated. Compared how ratings differ across these price segments. All segments have very similar rating ranges, but cheap products show a wider spread, and luxury products are more tightly clustered.

        <img width="691" height="547" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0acc28b9-92e8-477a-a27b-f0505c339c7c" />
 
    - Built different versions of a “value for money” score (including log and z-score normalization).
        - Results depend heavily on the definition. The results of the rating / log(price) approach favor cheap products. Using normalized score (z-score) leads to more balanced recommendations.
      
        The higher the score value, the better

- Analyzed market structure:

    - Showed strong imbalance: ~108k cheap products vs only ~300 luxury ones.

    - Compared average rating and popularity (review counts) across price segments.
        - The plot shows that the ratings across all segments are relatively stable over the years, with cheap and mid-priced products slightly improving over time, while the luxury products show more fluctuation due to a smaller sample size.
 
        <img width="691" height="546" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e21e4b3-95a1-4e14-9c97-79741088b2d9" />

        - Cheap products have the highest number of ratings, which is due to higher customer engagement and volume. Luxury products remain significantly less reviewed but show gradual growth in recent years. This suggests increasing interest in higher-end items.

- Performed review text analysis (NLP):

    - Processed reviews (tokenization, stopwords, etc)

    - Generated word distributions and word clouds.
  
      Example:

    - Tracked word trends over time and across brands.

    <img width="508" height="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06d8ba02-35cb-4d34-bb7e-9a82900cdc94" />

- Analyzed how certain keywords/phrases are distributed across brands or segments.

    - Luxury products receive more price-related language, both positive and negative. This suggests luxury buyers talk more about value for money in both directions - though price-related wording is ten times more prevalent in positive remarks than it is in negative ones. 

    <img width="479" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba18a3fa-5380-4d7d-b4e4-90dd13e0b6fb" />

    - Affordable/budget wording is concentrated in cheap products and almost absent in the luxury segment.

    <img width="488" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9f2d55-9d08-4ebe-b352-12878e9c87dc" />

    - Compared how often specific complaint keywords appear across price segments. It shows the highest frequency for cheap products. This supports the idea that lower-priced items get more complaints about physical failure, visible damage/durability.

    <img width="488" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7279f543-92f9-4c16-bd0b-c35b15f2d99c" />

    - Cheap products fail physically more often, but luxury products are judged more critically in terms of perceived quality. This reflects higher customer expectations and stricter evaluation standards.

    <img width="488" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4cf80f-02ae-4e73-af33-498f9a19f00e" />

    - Luxury products are more often associated with size/fit complaints.

    <img width="487" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1245da80-d4e1-4c1b-ac14-db1767c71c5c" />

    - Higher-priced products are more often praised for their appearance. On the other hand, lower-priced products are more often criticized for not matching expectations.

    <img width="488" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f943ae1-a27d-4feb-9dbd-4095c9e8626a" />

    - Comfort/usability complaints appear highest in the cheap segment, lowest in the mid segment, with luxury in between.

    <img width="488" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a151f742-17df-482d-84d4-177394c1a515" />



    - Identified which brands are most associated with specific words concerning complaints/praises for products in a specific price segment.

    - Ex: Which brands are most associated with “break/broken” complaints for cheap products.

        - Some brands have a significantly higher share of reviews mentioning breakage (around ~65–78%), highlighting clear differences in durability issues between brands within the same price segment.
      
    <img width="846" height="606" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b68520-c14f-49f1-a247-cc17fdbbf0dd" />
    

- Quantified how different types of customer complaints affect product ratings.
  
    - Processed review texts to identify specific complaint types using keyword-based pattern matching, including durability, size/fit, appearance, and color related issues.
      
    - Marked whether each review mentions one of these specific issues and then calculated, for each product, how often that issue appears across its reviews.
      
    - Filtered products with very few reviews to reduce noise and improve reliability of the analysis.
      
    - Built a multiple linear regression model to quantify the relationship between complaint types and product ratings.
      
    - Extended the analysis by comparing the relative impact of different complaint types to determine which issues most strongly drive customer dissatisfaction.
 
    - Performed segmented analysis across price categories (cheap / mid / luxury) to evaluate how the importance of complaint types varies across different price segments.
 
    - Visualized the impact of each complaint type using regression coefficients.

    <img width="857" height="596" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/740e281e-c281-44e3-94a6-f57c88ef1d57" />

    - Note: The luxury segment does not show statistically reliable results due to the very small number of available products, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions for expensive items.

  
- Part of the results:

- The jewelry market on Amazon is extremely skewed toward cheap products.

    - Cheap items dominate both in number of products and number of reviews (~100k+ cheap products vs only a few hundred luxury ones).
  
- Higher price does not consistently lead to higher ratings.

    - When comparing average ratings across price segments over time, expensive products are not clearly better rated than cheaper ones.
        - Customer satisfaction seems to depend more on expectations and perceived value than on price itself.

- Customer complaints follow clear patterns across price segments.

    - “Quality problems” are far less common in luxury products. 

    - On the other hand, size-related complaints are more noticeable in luxury items.
 
    - Luxury reviews emphasize value-for-money discussions, while cheap product reviews emphasize affordability, showing systematic differences in how price is discussed across segments.
       
    - Complaint patterns reveal a gap between quality and customer expectations. Cheaper products tend to have more physical failures (e.g., broken, defects). Luxury products, on the other hand, more often show subjective customer dissatisfaction (e.g., cheaply made) or focus more on value for money and expectations. As a result, customers tend to judge luxury items more critically.


- Brand rankings are highly dynamic over time. The yearly analysis shows that:

    - Top-ranked brands change frequently.
 
    - Market competition increases over time with more brands entering.
 
    - Certain brands show exceptionally high association with specific complaints in a price segment (e.g., up to ~65–78% of reviews mentioning breakage in cheap products). This reveals significant quality differences within the same price segment. 

    - Many top brands in a given year only have a few products.

 - Compared to appearance or fit issues, durability problems have a much bigger effect on ratings.

     - A 10 percente increase in durability complaints is associated with a decrease of approximately ~ 0.28 stars in average product rating, making durability the most critical factor affecting customer satisfaction.
  
     - Other complaint types such as size/fit, appearance, and color also negatively impact ratings, but with smaller effect sizes (~ 0.15 – 0.16 stars per 10% increase), indicating that not all issues are equally important to customers.
  
- The importance of complaint types varies across price segments.

     - In cheap products, durability issues have the strongest negative impact on ratings (coefficient ~ -2.9), dominating all other complaint types (size ~ -1.7, appearance ~ -1.5, and color ~ -1.6).
 
     - In mid-priced products, both durability and appearance-related complaints have a strong impact on ratings, with coefficients of approximately -2.9 for durability and -3.0 for appearance. This shows that customers in this price segment value both functionality and visual quality, with appearance having a slightly stronger effect. Other factors such as size (~ -0.2) and color (~ -0.7) have a noticeably smaller impact in this segment.
  
     - Customer priorities shift with price: from durability in cheap products to a combination of functionality and appearance in mid-priced products.
 
     - In luxury products, no clear pattern is observed due to the very small number of products, making results unreliable.
