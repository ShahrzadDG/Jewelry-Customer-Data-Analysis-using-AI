**Dataset Source**

The data used in this project comes from the Amazon Review Dataset (2023) provided by McAuley Lab:

https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/

From the available categories, the dataset Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry was downloaded. 

Since this dataset contains multiple product types, additional processing was performed to extract only the jewelry-related products and their corresponding reviews.

**Data Analysis part**

This project analyzes customer reviews from jewelry subset dataset of Amazon. I started with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset. I looked at brand performance, rating distributions, trends over time, and price segments. The goal is to extract insights from large-scale review data and rating, processing their text reviews, and identifying patterns in customer sentiment, preferences, and common issues.

The analysis resulted in findings on customer satisfaction trends, frequently mentioned product features, and sentiment distributions. These insights can be used to better understand customer expectations and support data-driven decisions in product development and marketing.


**Data Science Part**

This part of the project focuses on applying NLP techniques to extract insights from large-scale review data.

So far, a transformer-based sentiment classification model has been developed using DistilBERT. Reviews are classified into negative, neutral, and positive categories based on ratings. The model is evaluated using accuracy, macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score, along with confusion matrix and per-class analysis. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate whether RoBERTa could improve performance on the neutral class, which is typically more difficult to classify. 

Further steps of this project includes: (In progress)

- Topic modeling to identify dominant themes in reviews

- Aspect-based sentiment analysis (e.g., durability, design, size)

- LLM-based summarization

- Early product success prediction

- Fake review detection
